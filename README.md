# Memory Game App
A memory game with difficulty options and randomization.

Built in React, the game features card art from various Magic The Gathering cards.
Cards randomize afer each click. Get points for choosing a card, but don't click on the same card more than once! 

Try to get the top score of each difficulty, the randomization makes it very difficult.
